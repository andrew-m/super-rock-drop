Super Rock Drop

An attempt at learning Electron JS by writing a simple clone of Super Foul Eggs without the use of any game engines.

It started with this article on writing a Game Loop https://www.sitepoint.com/quick-tip-game-loop-in-javascript/
Which was in turn inspired by this remarkable talk by Mary Rose Cook who live codes Space invaders, in Javascript, whilst explaining what she's doing to a conference audience. https://vimeo.com/105955605

This started as a minimal Electron application based on the [Quick Start Guide](https://electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/quick-start) within the Electron documentation.

# Install dependencies
npm install
# Run the app
npm start
```
